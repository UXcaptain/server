# Logging & Visualizing logs

Logging is done with Pinojs --> https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino

Visualizing logs is done with BetterStack --> 

## Set up

- Create a new project on BetterStack
- Obtain as many API keys as needed (eg: PROD, DEV, etc) from https://telemetry.betterstack.com/team/304340/sources by creating new sources
- Add the API keys to the .env file

Bear in mind that we are using the pinojs logger in 3 scenarios:

- PROD --> Requires API key
- DEV --> Requires API key
- Localhost
